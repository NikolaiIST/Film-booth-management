# Some problems you may have

You may have some visual errors (I don't know why xd) when compiling the project using the "run" button of Netbeans, so it is better to find the JForm named "V_General.java" right click and "Run File", that would avoid the visual errors.

# Seat Reservation and Purchase

Select and reserve your preferred seats for a specific movie.
Make secure seat purchases using basic cards or Gold cards with exclusive discounts.

# Card Management

Register and manage credit cards associated with the user's account.
Reload cards for future purchases and take advantage of special discounts.

# Gold Card Discounts

Users with Gold cards enjoy exclusive discounts when purchasing seats, providing added value to Gold membership.


# How to get started

This project was developed using Netbeans interfaces, therefore, for it to work correctly you must run the Netbeans IDE and download the files from this repository, extract the resulting .zip and open it in the Netbeans IDE, if you need some libraries remember to install the .jar of the libraries in the "libraries" folder of the project, if you find any error you can communicate to nicolas.arboleda@ucp.edu.co.

# Contribute
